Trial Activation Experience

Promo Code: CASHFLO2025

When a user applies the promo code CASHFLO2025, the app should grant a 7-day Pro trial with full access to all Pro features.

The trial begins immediately after the code is successfully redeemed.

Trial Start Confirmation Popup

Trigger: Instantly after the code is applied successfully.

Popup message:

Your 7-day Pro trial has started 🎉
Enjoy full access to all Pro features until your trial ends.

Popup action:

Button: “Got it” or “Continue”

Closes the popup and returns the user to the app

Pro Trial Status Bar (Visible During Trial)

While the trial is active, display a Pro Trial status bar in the app (Dashboard and/or Settings).

The status bar must show:

Trial start date (date the code was applied)

Trial end date (start date + 7 days)

A progress bar that visually represents trial completion

Progress Bar Logic

The progress bar must be date-based, not usage-based.

Progress increases automatically based on the current date:

Day 1 → ~14%

Day 2 → ~28%

Day 3 → ~42%

Day 4 → ~57%

Day 5 → ~71%

Day 6 → ~85%

Day 7 → 100%

The bar should reach 100% at the end of Day 7.

After Trial Ends (Day 7 Completed)

Once the 7-day trial period is complete:

Pro features are automatically locked

The trial status bar switches to an expired state

Display this message clearly:

Your 7-day Pro trial has ended.
Purchase Pro to continue using premium features.

Call to action

Show an “Upgrade to Pro” button

Button redirects to the Pro purchase flow

Trial Restrictions

CASHFLO2025 is one-time use per user

After the trial ends:

The code cannot be reused
