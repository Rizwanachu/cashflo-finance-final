CRITICAL BUG FIX REQUIRED — DATA IS RESETTING AFTER REFRESH

The web app currently loses ALL user data after page refresh or reopening the site.
This must be fixed permanently.

TASK:
Fix the app so that ALL user data persists across:
- Page refresh
- Browser close & reopen
- Time delay
- New sessions

STRICT REQUIREMENTS:
1. Use ONLY browser-based persistence (NO backend, NO database, NO login).
2. Use localStorage as the single source of truth.
3. On app load:
   - Read all saved data from localStorage
   - Rehydrate the app state from localStorage
   - NEVER initialize empty/default state if saved data exists
4. Every data change must immediately sync to localStorage.

DATA THAT MUST BE PERSISTED:
- Transactions (income & expenses)
- Amounts, dates, categories
- Currency selection
- Dashboard totals
- Budget limits
- Pro / Free status
- Unlock code (if Pro)
- App settings (privacy mode, app lock, blur values)

IMPLEMENTATION RULES:
- Replace ALL useState initial values with a function that loads from localStorage
- Example pattern (must follow):

const [transactions, setTransactions] = useState(() => {
  const saved = localStorage.getItem("transactions");
  return saved ? JSON.parse(saved) : [];
});

- Add useEffect to save on every change:

useEffect(() => {
  localStorage.setItem("transactions", JSON.stringify(transactions));
}, [transactions]);

- Do this for EVERY piece of state.

IMPORTANT SAFETY CHECK:
- NEVER overwrite existing localStorage data on first render
- NEVER clear localStorage unless user explicitly clicks “Reset Data”

ADD THESE FEATURES:
1. Manual "Reset App Data" button (danger zone)
2. Confirmation dialog before reset
3. Auto data recovery on reload

FINAL VERIFICATION (MANDATORY):
- Add data
- Refresh page → data must stay
- Close browser → reopen → data must stay
- Wait 10 minutes → reopen → data must stay

DO NOT SHIP until this passes 100%.

This is a P0 bug.
Fix completely.
