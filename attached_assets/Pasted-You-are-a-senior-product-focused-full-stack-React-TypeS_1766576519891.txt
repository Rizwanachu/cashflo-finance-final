You are a senior product-focused full-stack React + TypeScript developer.

The app already has:
- Working Pro unlock system (PayPal + localStorage)
- Pricing page
- Pro feature locks
- Privacy-first architecture
- No signup, no ads, no backend

Your task now is to PREPARE THIS APP FOR PUBLIC LAUNCH and MAXIMIZE CONVERSION.

--------------------------------
STEP 1: FREE PLAN LIMITS (SO PRO MAKES SENSE)
--------------------------------

Add soft limits to Free users (non-annoying):

- Max 50 transactions total
- Max 1 year of history visible
- Advanced charts hidden
- PDF export locked (already done)

When limit is reached:
- Show a friendly banner:
  “You’ve reached the free limit. Upgrade to Pro to continue.”

Do NOT block existing data.
Do NOT delete user data.
Do NOT force upgrade.

--------------------------------
STEP 2: ONBOARDING (FIRST-USE EXPERIENCE)
--------------------------------

Add a lightweight onboarding flow shown only once:

- Welcome screen with:
  Headline: “Track your money. Privately.”
  Subtext: “No signup. No cloud. No ads.”

- Explain 3 things:
  1. Data stays on this device
  2. Works offline
  3. Pay once if you want Pro

- Button: “Start using app”
- Save `onboarding_complete = true` in localStorage

--------------------------------
STEP 3: SEO + SHAREABILITY
--------------------------------

Improve SEO for Netlify / Vercel:

- Add proper meta tags:
  - Title
  - Description
  - OpenGraph
  - Twitter cards

Example description:
“Simple private finance tracker. No signup. No ads. Your data stays on your device.”

Add:
- `/privacy`
- `/terms`
(Simple static pages, human-readable, no legal jargon)

--------------------------------
STEP 4: CONVERSION IMPROVEMENTS
--------------------------------

Add these subtle conversion helpers:

- “Go Pro” button in header (non-intrusive)
- Small “Pro” badge on locked features
- Pricing reminder after 7 days of use (once only)
- Pricing reminder after user exports CSV 3 times

All reminders must be dismissible forever.

--------------------------------
STEP 5: PRO VALUE REINFORCEMENT
--------------------------------

Every Pro screen should show:
“Lifetime access. One-time payment.”

Add a “Why Pro?” modal explaining:
- Supports development
- Keeps app ad-free
- Funds future features
- Still no tracking

--------------------------------
STEP 6: PRIVACY-SAFE ANALYTICS (OPTIONAL BUT IMPORTANT)
--------------------------------

Add OPTIONAL analytics toggle:

- Track only:
  - App opens
  - Pro upgrade click
  - Pro unlock success

Rules:
- Disabled by default
- No third-party trackers
- Stored locally only
- User must opt-in

--------------------------------
STEP 7: POLISH & LAUNCH CHECK
--------------------------------

Final checks:
- Mobile responsiveness
- Light & dark mode contrast
- No broken navigation
- No console errors
- Works after refresh
- Works offline

--------------------------------
FINAL OUTPUT
--------------------------------

A launch-ready finance app that:
- Converts Free → Pro naturally
- Feels trustworthy
- Is privacy-first
- Is ready to share publicly
- Can start making money immediately

Implement everything cleanly using reusable components and Tailwind.
Proceed step-by-step and apply changes directly to the existing codebase.
