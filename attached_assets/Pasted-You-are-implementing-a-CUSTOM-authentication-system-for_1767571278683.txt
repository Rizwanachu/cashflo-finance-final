You are implementing a CUSTOM authentication system for Spendory.
DO NOT use Replit Auth.
DO NOT use Clerk, Auth0, Firebase Auth, Supabase Auth, or any third-party auth UI.
This must be a simple, transparent, custom login layer.

CORE GOALS:
- Login is REQUIRED (used for user count, subscriptions, Pro access)
- User data NEVER leaves the device
- No transaction, account, or budget data is synced or uploaded
- App remains fully offline after login
- Login exists ONLY for identity + subscription continuity

ARCHITECTURE:
1. Identity Layer (Server):
   - Create a minimal backend auth service using Email + Google OAuth
   - Store ONLY:
     - userId
     - email
     - createdAt
     - subscriptionStatus (free / pro)
     - lastLoginAt
   - DO NOT store any finance data
   - DO NOT store backups
   - DO NOT store CSVs or app state

2. Client Storage (Device):
   - After login, generate a stable userId
   - Save userId + auth token in localStorage:
     - spendory-user-id
     - spendory-auth-token
   - All app data remains in:
     - spendory-transactions
     - spendory-accounts
     - spendory-budgets
     - etc.

3. Pro Access Logic:
   - On app load:
     - Verify auth token
     - Fetch subscriptionStatus
     - If pro → unlock features
     - If free → lock pro features
   - NEVER touch financial data during auth checks

STRICT RULES:
- Removing the app wipes financial data (expected behavior)
- Logging in again restores ONLY:
  - Pro access
  - Subscription status
- Login MUST NOT attempt to restore or sync finance data
- No silent defaults
- No auto-seeding during login

UI REQUIREMENTS:
- Replace Replit Auth UI completely
- Create Spendory-branded login screen:
  - "Continue with Google"
  - "Continue with Email"
- Show clear text:
  “Your financial data stays only on this device.”

SECURITY:
- Use JWT or signed session tokens
- Validate token on app boot
- Expired token → force re-login
- No background network calls after auth

REMOVE:
- Delete all Replit Auth config
- Remove any @replit/auth imports
- Remove Replit-provided login UI
- Remove Replit session handling

FINAL CHECK:
- App works offline after login
- Pro users keep Pro access after reinstall
- No financial data ever leaves device
- User count & subscriptions are trackable
- Replit Auth is fully gone
