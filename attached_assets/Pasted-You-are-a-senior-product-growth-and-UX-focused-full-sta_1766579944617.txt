You are a senior product, growth, and UX-focused full-stack React + TypeScript developer.

This finance app already has:
- Full freemium system
- PayPal lifetime Pro unlock
- Privacy-first architecture
- No signup, no backend, no ads
- Ready for Netlify / Vercel

Your task is to IMPLEMENT POST-LAUNCH GROWTH, TRUST, AND RETENTION FEATURES
without violating privacy principles.

--------------------------------
STEP 1: TRUST & CREDIBILITY LAYER
--------------------------------

Add a “Trust & Privacy” section accessible from:
- Footer
- Settings page

Include:
- “How this app protects your data”
- Bullet points:
  - All data stays on your device
  - No accounts
  - No cloud sync
  - No tracking unless user enables it
  - Open-source friendly architecture (even if repo is private)

Add a small “Verified Privacy” badge component (visual only).

--------------------------------
STEP 2: IN-APP SOCIAL PROOF (NO FAKE REVIEWS)
--------------------------------

Add a lightweight, honest social proof banner:

Examples:
- “Used by people who value privacy.”
- “Built for people who don’t trust cloud finance apps.”

Do NOT show fake numbers.
Do NOT show fake testimonials.

This banner should appear:
- Once after onboarding
- Once on pricing page

Dismissible forever.

--------------------------------
STEP 3: RETENTION SYSTEM (VERY IMPORTANT)
--------------------------------

Add a local-only usage streak system:

Track:
- Days app opened
- Days with at least 1 transaction added

Show:
- “You’ve tracked your finances for X days”
- “Consistency badge” after 7, 30, 90 days

All stored locally.
No notifications.
No pressure.

--------------------------------
STEP 4: PRO USER DELIGHT
--------------------------------

If user is Pro:
- Show subtle “Pro Active” indicator
- Show “Thank you for supporting this app” message (once)
- Unlock small cosmetic upgrade:
  - Slightly enhanced card styles
  - Pro badge in settings

Do NOT add paywalls for Pro users ever again.

--------------------------------
STEP 5: EXPORT & OWNERSHIP MESSAGE
--------------------------------

Add a section explaining data ownership:

“Your data is yours. You can export anytime.”

Add buttons:
- Export CSV (Free)
- Export PDF (Pro)

Explain formats briefly so users trust exports.

--------------------------------
STEP 6: SHARE WITHOUT SPAM
--------------------------------

Add a soft “Share this app” option:
- Button text: “Share with someone who values privacy”
- Copy link to clipboard
- No forced popups
- No tracking

--------------------------------
STEP 7: FINAL LAUNCH MODE
--------------------------------

Add a `launchMode` flag (boolean).

When enabled:
- Remove all debug UI
- Remove placeholders
- Ensure clean console
- Ensure SEO meta tags are correct
- Ensure pricing links work
- Ensure PayPal link opens correctly

--------------------------------
FINAL OUTPUT
--------------------------------

A production-ready, trustworthy, privacy-first finance app that:
- Retains users
- Encourages Pro upgrades naturally
- Builds trust without manipulation
- Is ready for public launch, Reddit, Product Hunt, and word-of-mouth
- Can generate sustainable revenue without ads or subscriptions

Implement everything cleanly using reusable components and Tailwind.
Proceed step-by-step and apply changes directly to the existing codebase.
