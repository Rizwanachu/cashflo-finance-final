You are a senior full-stack React + TypeScript developer.

I already have a finance dashboard web app built with:
- React
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- LocalStorage (no backend)
- Deployed on Netlify / Vercel

Your task is to implement a COMPLETE freemium monetization system using ONLY PayPal and localStorage.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Do NOT use Stripe or Razorpay
- Do NOT require signup
- Do NOT add ads
- Keep everything privacy-first and offline-friendly
- The app must still work perfectly when deployed to Netlify

--------------------------------
STEP 1: PRO LOCK + GO PRO MODAL
--------------------------------

1. Add a global `isProUser` state.
   - Default: false
   - Stored in localStorage
   - Example key: `cashflo_pro = true | false`

2. Lock these features behind Pro:
   - PDF export (CSV stays free)
   - Advanced analytics section
   - App Lock / Privacy Mode

3. When a locked feature is clicked:
   - Show a clean modal titled: “Go Pro”
   - Modal must explain benefits clearly
   - Modal must have:
     - “Lifetime Access” badge
     - PayPal purchase button
     - “Restore Purchase” input for unlock code

4. PayPal button behavior:
   - Opens an external PayPal payment link (placeholder URL is fine)
   - Text: “Pay once. Use forever.”

5. Unlock system:
   - After payment, user enters a Pro Unlock Code
   - If code matches a predefined list, unlock Pro
   - Save Pro status in localStorage
   - Pro persists after refresh

--------------------------------
STEP 2: ADVANCED ANALYTICS
--------------------------------

1. Create a new page or section:
   - “Advanced Analytics (Pro)”

2. Include:
   - Yearly income vs expenses
   - Monthly breakdown chart
   - Category spending percentages

3. Use existing transaction data from localStorage.

4. If user is not Pro:
   - Blur analytics
   - Show “Upgrade to Pro to unlock”

--------------------------------
STEP 3: APP LOCK + PRIVACY MODE
--------------------------------

1. Add App Lock (Pro only):
   - Optional PIN (4 digits)
   - Stored securely in localStorage
   - Lock activates on page reload

2. Add Privacy Mode toggle:
   - Blur all money values
   - Blur charts
   - Blur recent transactions
   - Toggle persists across sessions

--------------------------------
STEP 4: PRICING PAGE
--------------------------------

Create a dedicated `/pricing` page with:

FREE PLAN:
- Manual transactions
- Basic dashboard
- CSV export
- No signup
- No ads

PRO (LIFETIME):
- One-time payment
- PDF export
- Advanced analytics
- App lock & privacy mode
- Unlimited usage
- Priority future features

CTA buttons:
- “Continue Free”
- “Upgrade to Pro”

--------------------------------
STEP 5: MARKETING COPY
--------------------------------

Add this copy in the app (hero / footer / pricing):

Headline:
“Simple. Private. No ads. No signup.”

Subtext:
“Your financial data never leaves your device.”

Trust badges:
- No tracking
- No cloud
- Works offline
- Pay once, use forever

--------------------------------
STEP 6: CODE QUALITY
--------------------------------

- Use clean reusable components
- Use Tailwind for styling
- Ensure dark mode & light mode readability
- Fix contrast issues in cards, charts, and text
- Ensure all layouts are aligned correctly
- No broken navigation

--------------------------------
FINAL OUTPUT EXPECTATION
--------------------------------

- Fully working Pro system
- PayPal-based monetization (manual unlock)
- Clean UI
- Ready to deploy on Netlify
- No backend required

Proceed step-by-step and implement everything directly into the existing project.
